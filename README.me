# Hands off doomscrolling controller

Controls:
- open palm: scroll to next video
- thumbs up: like video (double click center of screen)
    - click s with the camera open to save a mouse position
    - ex: position over like button and it'll click once
- closed fist: pause
- point up: scroll to previous video
- thumbs down: quit program

works well when only one hand is in the frame
